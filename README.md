# ScrumBoard
Project of simple scrum board dedicated to work in small teams. The main functions that have been implemented are:
  - drag and drop tasks between columns,
  - filter tasks due to a team member,
  - the task database is downloaded from JSON file.

To build the app, I've used React. The main functions are using vanilla JavaScript while The view is created in Sass.

The app is constantly developed. In the near future I plan to:

  - rebuild the task template,
  - add the ability to create new tasks,
  - add the ability to menage a few projects at the same time,
  - add login panel.
